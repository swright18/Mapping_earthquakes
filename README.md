The purpose of this analysis was to create map visualizations using Leaflet.js, D3.js, and GeoJSON, along with API's to demonstrate earthquake magnitudes across the globe over the last 7 days and tectonic plate locations. 

## Summary:

To complete this analyisis, GeoJSON was used to access earthquake data from the USGS website and along with geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. This data was added to a map, including various different map styles. By layering mutliple map functions, you able to turn on and off the tectonic plates, major earthquakes, and all earthquakes.
